## Execution instructions:
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn test` to execute tests with es6 support
- `yarn output` to execute output script with babel-node

The input and output amounts differed, so I opted to go with the output amounts.
Also, it appears that the importDuty was left out of the output amounts, so
unless I am missing something, my totals include the base amount with import duty
applied and the correct sales tax (excluding the exempt products).
